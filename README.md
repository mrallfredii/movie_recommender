Features of the movie recommender project

1) Data collection: First, it is needed to collect a dataset of movies that I will use to train the model. This dataset include information such as the title, genre, release date, and user ratings from a CSV file.

2) Data preprocessing: After collecting the dataset, I will need to clean and preprocess the data. This could include removing missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.

3) Feature engineering: Next, will be needed to engineer features that will be used as input to the model. This could include creating new features based on the existing data, such as the average rating or the popularity of a movie.

4) Model selection: Now will be needed to select a model that will be used for the recommendation system. Some popular models for recommendation systems include collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks. In this scenario I will go with neural networks.

5) Model training: Once the model is selected, will be needed to train it on the preprocessed dataset. You will also need to select a suitable evaluation metric to measure the performance of your model.

6) Model evaluation: After training the model, will be needed to evaluate its performance on a held-out test set to ensure that it is able to make accurate recommendations.
